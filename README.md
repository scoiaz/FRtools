  Project built as a way to learn the python language in general 
and a few classes like:
  - PyQt 5 and 6
  - OpenCV
  - MySQL
  - others will be added as I evolve

  In this project in particular I'm focusing on face recognition.

  There are a few ideas for how it can be used and hopefully a
more elaborated objective will spawn from it.
